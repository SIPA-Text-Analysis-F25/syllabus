**Course Description:** We are living in the information age, a historical era characterized by a shift from industrial production to one based on information and computerization. In practical terms, this means we are experiencing a period of history that is overflowing with what is termed "big data." These are text and numeric data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software and instead require computational methods like Python for data collection, processing, and analysis. Since "big data" encapsulates all of the digital trails we leave behind in our interconnected world, these data points present new opportunities to uncover insights that are of critical importance to policy leaders today. By using a programming language like Python, we can extract meaning from society's digital imprints to research social questions at a groundbreaking scale.

In addition to being a powerful tool for working with “big data,” Python can also be used for web development, data analytics, machine learning, data science, data engineering, and artificial intelligence, making Python a highly marketable skill for job seekers. Moreover, since Python mirrors the logic of the English language, its syntax is relatively easy to read and learn for English speakers. Python is also a great programming language for those who want to self-learn since its users form an active and supportive online community dedicated to creating and sharing free tutorials, developing open-source programs, and answering questions.

This introductory course will explore a variety of approaches to studying text-as-data, collected from newspapers, social media, websites, and any other kind of text data source using the programming language Python. Designed for students with foundational Python skills, students will leave this course with beginner-to-intermediate Python programming abilities and the tools to continue building their skills beyond the classroom. Students will learn the fundamentals of the data process in addition to gaining hands-on experience with methods for data collection (e.g., web scraping and working with APIs) and text analysis (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and more). Students will also learn how to use generative AI models to develop sophisticated data collection and analysis scripts. 

Practical in nature, the course will culminate in a final project that will ask students to explore a research question of their choice using the various methods for data collection and analysis learned across the semester, which students can then share as public scholarship and/or with prospective employers. The course content is geared towards students interested in pursuing careers in journalism, marketing, social media strategy, policy analysis, financial analysis, and tech.

**Learning Objectives:**   
Student who take this course can expect:

* To gain foundational knowledge of the Python programming language.  
* To practice the principles of data and text analysis, including data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
* To collect text data through web scraping and connecting to APIs with Python.  
* To analyze text data using a variety of methodologies including sentimental analysis, topic modeling, named entity recognition, and term-frequency inverse document frequency with Python.  
* To use search engines and generative AI platforms for learning how to use Python in their own projects.  
* To self-learn Python skills with confidence.  
* To communicate with data-science or product teams.

**Grading Requirements:** 

Final grades will be based on a combination of participation, in-class presentations, homework assignments, and a short final paper. This course emphasizes active, hands-on learning and collaborative exploration, so consistent engagement is key to your success.

| Component | Weight | Description |
| :---- | ----- | ----- |
| **Participation** | 10% | Active engagement in class discussions, group work, and coding exercises. |
| **In-Class Presentations** | 35% | Each student will present their final project (2 mins) during the last class session |
| **Homework Assignments** | 30% | Four structured problem sets designed to reinforce core skills.  |
| **Final Paper** | 25% | A 1,000 word paper \+ code project pairing a method of data collection and text analysis. The final project will live in GitHub, helping students build a professional data science portfolio. |

**Late work policy:** Extensions may be granted with prior notice. Unexcused late submissions will be subject to a deduction of 10% per day.

**Attendance Policy:** Your class attendance is mandatory. Failure to properly inform me of a foreseen or unforeseen conflict before class time will result in a diminished participation grade. SIPA no longer offers a Zoom option for class.

**(New) Policy on the use of Generative AI in this course:** Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT can be helpful learning tools especially for beginner level coders. For this reason, we will test out how to use these tools in the classroom. I cannot control your use of Generative AI platforms to complete the homework assignments but I would encourage you to try to solve them on your own first. Learning how to code is akin to learning a new language. It wouldn’t make sense to always rely on a computer to speak for you. We will also review the proper way to cite when you use AI tools. I will not penalize you for using these tools to help with writing your projects, as long as you are honest about it.

**Required materials for purchase:** Bringing a laptop computer to class is a requirement. There are no additional materials for purchase required for this course.

**Weekly class structure (sessions 1-3):**

* Lecture (15 min)  
* Hands-On Live Coding (120 min, two topics with 30 min break in between)  
* Student-Driven Work with Faculty Support (60 min)

**Session 1:  Working with APIs \+ Web Scraping (9/20/25)**

This week, we will learn how to make data requests from an Application Programming Interface (API). APIs allow users to programmatically extract and interact with data under the hood of websites, social networks, applications, and projects. For example, the weather app on your phone connects to the weather bureau's API system, which contains daily weather data, and shows you daily weather updates. We will specifically work with the free version of News API for collecting news data.

We will also use the Beautiful Soup Python library for web scraping. Web scraping is the process of extracting content and data from a website using a programming language. In this case, we will web scrape to extract text from websites.  
We will also learn how to extract news articles from the Factiva News database and store the results in a Pandas dataframe.

**Session 2: Social Media Data and Sentiment Analysis** **(9/27/25)**

This week, we will learn how to make data requests from the YouTube API. We will use the Pandas library to wrangle, clean, analyze, and visualize YouTube data. We will also discuss approaches for collecting other types of social media data, including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, and more. 

We will also learn how to perform a sentiment analysis using social media data, including Youtube comments. Sentiment analysis, also referred to as opinion mining, is a method for identifying the emotional tone behind a body of text.

**Session 3: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) \+ Topic Modeling**

This week, we will learn about term frequency-inverse document frequency, often abbreviated TF-IDF. TF-IDF is a text analysis method that builds off word frequency but it more specifically tries to identify the most distinctively frequent and significant words.

We will also learn how to use topic modeling to quickly parse out the primary topics across a collection of text files. Topic modeling can help ​​identify clusters of words that show up together in statistically meaningful ways throughout a corpus of text. We will use the Tomotopy Python library for topic modeling.

* Topics covered:  
  * What is TF-IDF?  
  * What are practical applications of TF-IDF?  
  * How to perform TF-IDF on a collection of speeches?  
  * How to use this method with other text data sources?

If you are a student with a disability and have a DS-certified accommodation letter, you may wish to make an appointment with your course instructor to discuss your accommodations. Faculty provide disability accommodations to students with DS-certified accommodation letters, and they provide the accommodations specified in such letters.  If you have any additional questions, please contact SIPA’s DS liaison at disability@sipa.columbia.edu or 212-854-8690.*
